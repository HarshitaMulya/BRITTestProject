API Testing Approach: Document a high-level approach for API testing, including potential scenarios for exploratory testing.
Below are the high-level API Testing Approach: -
1.Understand the API Requirements through API Documentation and getting to know which all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are supported by the API.
2.	Defining a testing scope.
3.	Choosing proper testing tools for API testing.
4.	Write appropriate test cases for the APIs and use testing techniques like boundary value analysis, equivalence class, etc. for verifying the functionality.
5.	Define the scope and basic functionality of the API program. 
6.	Define the accurate input parameters. 
7.	Make proper API call sequencing.
8.	 Test case execution and comparison of the results with expected results.
9.	Exploratory testing involves testing the API without predefined test cases
10. Dynamically exploring different use cases, error scenarios, and edge cases.
        This process can uncover issues like Unauthorized Access, Invalid or Missing Data, Rate Limiting, Handling Unexpected Server Errors
